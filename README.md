# EX - 11 : Implementation of Elliptic curve Cryptography

## AIM:
  Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography using a Standard Library.

## ALGORITHM:
1.Start the program and import the required libraries.
2.Define the elliptic curve parameters (a, b) and prime modulus (p) that define the curve 
(y^2=x^3+ax+b)
3.Implement the point addition and point doubling operations for elliptic curves.
4.Implement scalar multiplication to perform cryptographic operations.
5.Use the scalar multiplication function to generate a public key from a private key.
6.Use ECC to perform key exchange or encryption.
7.End the program.

## PROGRAM:

```C
    
```

## OUTPUT:


## RESULT:
The implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography using a standard library is successful.
